# How to Contribute Anonymously
```{important}

The government has consistently demonstrated the capability to track individuals, and there have been instances of abductions and severe consequences for those who speak out or act against the regime. It is crucial to take every precaution to protect yourself while contributing anonymously. 

Even if local agencies lack the expertise to track you, they may collaborate with international allies to identify and locate individuals. This reality underscores the importance of maintaining anonymity and safeguarding your digital footprint.

It is a tragic reflection of our current state that such measures are necessary. However, we must remain vigilant and cautious as we pursue what is just and right.

## Creating a Private GitHub Account
1. Use your anonymous email to sign up for a new GitHub account.
2. Choose a username that does not match any of your social media handles or other online identities.
3. Avoid uploading profile pictures or any personal information.

## Using a VPN
- Always use a reputable VPN service to mask your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic.
- Avoid free VPNs as they may log your data. Consider paid options like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or `Mullvad`.

## Avoiding Identifiable IDE Plugins
- Use lightweight text editors like VS Code or Vim without installing plugins that may transmit identifiable data.
- Avoid IDEs that sync settings or extensions with your personal accounts.

## Using Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Set up a VM for your anonymous contributions.
- Regularly rotate or recreate your VMs to minimize tracking.
- Use privacy-focused operating systems like Tails or `Qubes` OS within your VM.

## Avoiding Public Wi-Fi
- Never use public Wi-Fi for anonymous contributions. If unavoidable, always connect through a VPN.

## Additional Tips to Avoid Surveillance
1. Use Tor Browser for added anonymity when accessing GitHub or related services.
2. Avoid sharing any personal details in your commits or repository descriptions.
3. Regularly clear your browser cookies and cache.
4. Disable JavaScript in your browser when possible to reduce tracking risks.

By following these steps, you can contribute to GitHub anonymously while minimizing your digital footprint.
